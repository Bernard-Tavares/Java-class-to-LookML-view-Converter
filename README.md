<h1>Java to LookML Converter</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project includes a Python script designed to automate the conversion of Java class files into LookML view files. It focuses on processing Java files for Looker projects by extracting relevant metadata and annotations and generating corresponding LookML code.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Java File Processing</strong>: Reads and filters Java files from a specified directory.</li>
        <li><strong>Classification and Prioritization</strong>: Classifies and processes files based on type ('public class' or 'public abstract class').</li>
        <li><strong>Annotation Extraction</strong>: Extracts annotations, properties, and table names from Java class files.</li>
        <li><strong>LookML Generation</strong>: Generates LookML view code based on extracted Java file information.</li>
        <li><strong>Base Class Check</strong>: Verifies the existence of LookML files for base classes.</li>
        <li><strong>Output Management</strong>: Saves generated LookML code in the specified directory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usage Summary</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Setup</strong>: Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.</li>
        <li><strong>Configuration</strong>: Modify the source and destination directory paths in the script.</li>
        <li><strong>Running the Script</strong>: Execute the script to process Java files and generate LookML files.</li>
        <li><strong>Git Integration</strong>: Use Git commands to manage the version control of generated LookML files.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Note</h2>
    <p>Ensure Python is installed on your system. Basic Git operations knowledge is recommended.</p>
